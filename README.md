# ModularCalculator
Task: Create modular calculator where you can add functionality without rebuilding

## Hour 1
In the first hour I did some research since I've never worked on anything like this project. I figured out that I would use dll files to provide the functions for calculator app.
Some materials I used are: 
 - [Creating and Using DLL (Class Library) in C#](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/1e050f/creating-and-using-dll-class-library-in-C-Sharp/)
 - [How to Make & Use (.dll) files in Visual Studio | Using Class Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPOuci-6amQ&ab_channel=TACV-TheAmazingCode-Verse)

I also created 2 git repositories and projects in Visual Studio and pushed them to GitHub. The main project is [Modular Calculator](https://github.com/PeterisEcis/ModularCalculator) and the functions for the calculator will be here [Calculator Functions](https://github.com/PeterisEcis/CalculatorFunctions).
